This document contains meeting notes from the Meta working group.

**Written by:** [@nikomatsakis][nikomatsakis]

**Purpose of meeting**:

- Clarify the “scope” of the meta working group.
  - What problems does the meta working group aim to solve?
  - What problems do we want to avoid creating? (e.g. bureaucracy, administrative overhead)
- Discuss working group “bootstrap process”
  - What should each working group define?
  - What structure should a WG “check-in” have?
  - Can we produce a “WG Template” that I can then pass around to folks to fill out?
- What are the most actionable ideas and can we rank those?
- Which ideas would be better suited for more “discussion meetings”?
  - Steering meetings? Or should we use those for something else

**Working Group Components**:

- Zulip Stream(s)
- Zulip User Group (`WG-compiler-foo`)
- GitHub Team? Someway for people to get notifications
- GitHub Labels
- Contact points:
  - Leads
  - Compiler team liason — who will present
  - Maybe others that you can ping on Zulip to ask questions
  
- Across team:
  - Some kind of table summarizing WGs


- Membership (default):
  - We want to avoid any sort of formal membership to a working group. Instead a wg has leads and interested folk can subscribe to it to receive notifications on GitHub issues and in Zulip.
