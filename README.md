## Meeting Calendar

Unless otherwise noted, all our meetings are open to the public and
held on Zulip. There are two main team-wide meetings that we hold as a
regular basis. There are also a variety of working group meetings. The
team-wide meetings are as follows:

- **Triage meeting:** We have a weekly triage meeting to discuss and
  track regressions and urgent changes. This meeting is held on Zulip
  and open to anyone.
- **Steering meeting:** We have a steering meeting every three weeks
  to track and plan our larger goals. This meeting is held on Zulip
  and open to anyone.
