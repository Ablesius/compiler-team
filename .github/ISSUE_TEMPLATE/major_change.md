# Directions

If you'd like to propose a major change to do to rustc, you've come to
the right place! To do so, please write-up your proposal in this issue.

Describe your major change in a sentence or two under the TL;DR section.

If available, add links and more descriptions in the "Links and Details" section.
Note: it is not expected that you write a fully fleshed out proposal there.
Just add any information you think is important.

List people already mentoring you on this change or reviewing this change in the "Mentors or Reviewers" section
If there are none, you can also add people that you think would be a good fit.
You can look at [the experts map](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/content/experts/map.toml) for ideas.

Oh, and please delete this section before you open the issue -- but
keep the others!
