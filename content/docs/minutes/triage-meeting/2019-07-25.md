# 2019-07-25

## Volunteers wanted

- [#60297](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60297) - we are looking for someone with access to ARM/musl to help debug this

- [#62896](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62896) and [#62932](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62932) - there are some embedded failures, quite possibly related to LLVM, that could use bisection

## Backport nominations

- [Make the parser TokenStream more resilient after mismatched delimiter recovery](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull62887)
  - Approved for beta backport

## Working group sync

No working group sync this week.
