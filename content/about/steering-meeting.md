# Steering Meeting

The compiler **steering meeting** is the place for high-level
discussion and planning. The meeting takes place weekly. The topics of
the meeting are selected at periodic planning meetings. See the
[steering meeting procedure][proc] for more details. See [#58850] for
more information.

[proc]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/steering-meeting.html

See the [compiler team calendar](../../#meeting-calendar) for
the topics of the next scheduled meetings. There is also a [dedicated
internals thread][internals].

[#58850]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58850
[internals]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/compiler-steering-meeting/8588

The steering meeting takes place on [Zulip](../chat-platform/). Look
for a topic like "steering meeting YYYY-MM-DD" (with today's date, of
course).

There are [minutes from previous steering
meetings][minutes] available in this
repository. These minutes summarize our conversations.
