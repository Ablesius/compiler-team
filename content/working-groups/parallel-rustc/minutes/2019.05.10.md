[Zulip topic.](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/planning.20meeting.202019.2E05.2E10/near/165339223)

## Plan for parallel-rustc

1. Gather the performance data of the feature internally
2. Make a "go/no-go" decision based on the data

## Overall conclusions

The [overall conclusions](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/design.20meeting.202019.2E05.2E17/near/165907247) was that before shipping we should improve the documentation. To that end, we are trying to [gather major design questions in a hackmd document](https://hackmd.io/XDC24IlWT4OIxYdmIxH4Xg). Here is a link to the start of a [discussion about documentation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/design.20meeting.202019.2E05.2E17/near/165905977).

## Gathered data

The most important data on our plan are recorded on [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/KmHulVmISKu7L2HmNgbPgg?both).

Experiments on other work-load are also welcome. The data are reported in the following topics on `Zulip#t-compiler/wg-parallel-rustc`:

* [Gathering parallel data](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187679-t-compiler.2Fwg-parallel-rustc/topic/Gathering.20parallel.20data)
* [effect on firefox](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187679-t-compiler.2Fwg-parallel-rustc/topic/effect.20on.20firefox)

We also discussed performance tradeoffs. Towards the end of the meeting, we noted some research on [what sorts of compilation time hits are noticebale to users](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/design.20meeting.202019.2E05.2E17/near/165918020), which is relevant to the "single core overhead" we are willing to tolerate from using locks.
