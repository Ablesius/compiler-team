# Debugging Working Group
![working group status: active][status]

This working group's focus is to provide users with a good experience when debugging Rust code.

- **Team:** [wg-debugging on rust-lang/team](https://github.com/rust-lang/team/blob/master/teams/wg-debugging.toml)

[status]: https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge

## What is the goal of this working group?
This working group aims to accomplish the following:

- Improve the debuginfo generated by rustc so that it is accurate and useful to debuggers
- Support efforts to split debuginfo from binary artifacts
- Better integrate with trace-based debuggers
- Triage the backlog of `A-debuginfo` issues
- Increase the size of the debuginfo test suite and ensure we have good test coverage

## How can I get involved?
If you are interested in getting involved in this working group, you should stop by the Zulip stream and introduce yourself!

- **Desired experience level:** Any
- **Relevant repositories:** [`rust-lang/rust`][repo]
- **Zulip stream:** [`#t-compiler/wg-debugging`][zulip] on Zulip

[repo]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust
[zulip]: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com

## What if I don't have much time?
Consider re-testing issues in the `rust` repository and leaving a comment to confirm if it is still an issue or not.
Resolved issues should also have regression tests added.

## Are there any resources so I can get up to speed?

The rustc-dev-guide has a chapter on [debugging support in the Rust compiler](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/debugging-support-in-rustc.html).

## Do I need to attend any meetings?
We don't have regularly scheduled meetings yet.
