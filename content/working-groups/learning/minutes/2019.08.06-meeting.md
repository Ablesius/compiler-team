# Learning WG 2019-08-06 sync meeting

- @Tshepang Lekhonkhobe joined the Learning WG!

- @mark-i-m reported that toolslate/linkcheck is now working properly with following overview on how:
    - The linkchecker in the rust CI is run from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/rustbook.
    - It just runs `mdbook_linkcheck` as a library.
    - That is called by only one linux builder from the script in `src/ci/docker/`.
    - The hack on the `rustc-dev-guide` CI checks the output of `mdbook_linkcheck` from `stdout/stderr` and looks for timeout errors.
    - If timeout errors are equal to the number of errors `mdbook_linkcheck` reported, then build is passed.

- @Santiago Pastorino mentions two major tasks for the WG (in an explanation):
    - one is watching the lectures and summarizing them as guides chapter.
    - and the other one is triaging and paying attention to the issue tracker.

- @Santiago Pastorino shared URL for traigebot documentation https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot/wiki/Assignment.
