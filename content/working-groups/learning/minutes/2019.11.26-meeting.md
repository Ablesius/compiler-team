# Learning WG 2019-11-26 planning meeting


- Team discussed most important missing chapters from the [master doc].
  - A consensus was reached which was noted on the [master doc].
  - Prioritizing the Overview lecture and doc over others.
  - Working as a team on the lecture/doc.
- Team discussed to work with Hackmd vs Paper
  - For this Overview doc. 
  - So we have experience with Paper as well as Hackmd.
- Team discussed about Working Process
  - @Santiago mentioned that it might be a good idea to tackle two things in parallel
	- 1. A lecture arrangement.
	- 2. A document summary of something else.
  - @mark-i-m proposed (again) that we might benefit from a Sprint-like process
	- Pick a topic and work towards a goal for say 2 months.
	- Team seems to like this sprint-like process idea.
	- Team will try this for next two months and recalibrate as necessary.
- Next steps
	- @Santiago opened [PR for Ty lecture].
	- @mark-i-m started to arrange lecture for `Monomorph, LLVM`.
	- @Santiago started [doc for Overview chapter].
