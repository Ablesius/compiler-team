# Learning WG 2019-07-23 sync meeting

## Rustc-guide strike force

- Need to go through older issues on repo and see what is actionable for each one
- Easier issues need to just get done
- Harder issues may need a talk/meeting with an expert

- spastorino proposes writing a post on IRLO
    - mark-i-m volunteers to do this

## Long meeting

- Last time, we discussed scheduling a long meeting
    - mark-i-m proposes August 19, but spastorino notes that this is close to
      RustConf. Maybe it is ok anyway if that is ok with Niko.
