# Learning Working Group
![working group status: active][status]

This working group aims to make the compiler easier to learn by ensuring that rustc-guide and api docs are "complete".

## What is the goal of this working group?
This working group aims to accomplish the following:

- Ensure that major components of rustc are covered in rustc-guide
- Ensure that API doc coverage is at least 90%

# How can I get involved?
If you are interested in getting involved in this working group, come and say hi in the Zulip
stream. You can be added to the Zulip group for the working group if you are interested in being
pinged when there are available tasks.

## Process
We are trying to follow a "sprint-like" structure where on each "sprint" cycle we start with a planning and then
work towards the goals defined on that plan. Our current plan is to work for 2 months on a couple of goals, with a few meetings to sync up during that period. We are working towards filling out missing parts of the rustc-guide and building some chapters that help gain an overall understanding of what the compiler does to code to produce its output.

- **Desired experience level:** Any
- **Relevant repositories:** [`rust-lang/rust`][rust-repo] and [`rust-lang/rustc-guide`][rustc-guide-repo]
- **Zulip stream:** [`#t-compiler/wg-learning`][zulip] on Zulip
