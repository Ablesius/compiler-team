### [wg-rustc-dev-guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rustc-dev-guide/)

wg-rustc-dev-guide's objective is to make the compiler easier to learn by ensuring that rustc-dev-guide is "complete".

Currently they're working on:

1. Getting [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAUGvNgZYtw) about parts of the compiler from people who know them
2. Turning existing video lectures into content for the [rustc-dev-guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide)
3. Triaging and working on issues and pull requests for rustc-dev-guide content

Help is always wanted!
