## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2024-02-7](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2024-02-27.md)

A rare week where regressions out powered improvements to make the compiler roughly half a percent slower on average on nearly 100 benchmarks. Some regressions have fixes in the pipeline, but some remain elusive or were introduced to address correctness issues.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [5af21304..71ffdf7f](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=5af2130440c198afefbe5b8099342057cf272ef4&end=71ffdf7ff7ac6df5f9f64de7e780b8345797e8a0&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |

| All  (primary)           | 0.4%  | [-3.3%, 4.4%]  | 97    |


4 Regressions, 6 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
58 artifact comparisons made in total

#### Regressions

Always evaluate free constants and statics, even if previous errors occurred [#121087](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/121087) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5af2130440c198afefbe5b8099342057cf272ef4&end=cce6a6e22e715bd74455f2560a956ab920c3a914&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean | range        | count |
|:------------------------:|:----:|:------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.8% | [0.4%, 2.0%] | 4     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 1.0% | [0.3%, 5.2%] | 11    |
| Improvements (primary)   | -    | -            | 0     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -    | -            | 0     |
| All  (primary)           | 0.8% | [0.4%, 2.0%] | 4     |
- Regressions in primary benchmarks are real and addressed in #121387
- Regressions in secondary benchmarks seem to be all noise.


Use intrinsics::debug_assertions in debug_assert_nounwind [#120863](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120863) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=29f87ade9d78d233e85ef6ca2d6153d0d4fd38d6&end=2b43e75c98cc5ae32328c8b49657bcd882eb5e75&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.8%  | [0.3%, 1.7%]   | 13    |
| Regressions (secondary)  | -     | -              | 0     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -0.4% | [-0.4%, -0.4%] | 1     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -     | -              | 0     |
| All  (primary)           | 0.7%  | [-0.4%, 1.7%]  | 14    |
- Pinged the author on what next steps are. Regression is in codegen which would be expected given the nature of the change, but it's unclear how one would address the issue.


wasm: Store rlib metadata in wasm object files [#120588](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120588) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0987e41d1ccbae7a8a55fdcde4af0ea76ebfe2d3&end=7168c13579a550f2c47f7eea22f5e226a436cd00&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean | range        | count |
|:------------------------:|:----:|:------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 3.1% | [3.0%, 3.3%] | 4     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 1.5% | [0.2%, 2.9%] | 33    |
| Improvements (primary)   | -    | -            | 0     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -    | -            | 0     |
| All  (primary)           | 3.1% | [3.0%, 3.3%] | 4     |
- Regressions seem legit but nothing in self profiling stands out as a likely culprit. 
- Asked the author for more investigation.


Subtree update of `rust-analyzer` [#121581](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/121581) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=710048f790ebc9ebfac6039c6733570f8084c9de&end=43fdd4916d19f4004e23d422b5547637ad67ab21&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean | range        | count |
|:------------------------:|:----:|:------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.7% | [0.7%, 0.8%] | 4     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.4% | [0.2%, 0.7%] | 23    |
| Improvements (primary)   | -    | -            | 0     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -    | -            | 0     |
| All  (primary)           | 0.7% | [0.7%, 0.8%] | 4     |
- This is all noise - regressions revert in the next run.

- Lots of seemingly risky PRs in this roll up. Need to run through them.

- Improvements far outweigh the regressions so I don't think this needs further investigation.

- The large regression that caused this to be marked overall as a regression is just noise.

- [#121625](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/121625) is meant to try to address this.
- Given the complex nature of the change, I imagine a revert is not desirable even if performance can't be gained back.
