  > Esteban reports: The diagnostics namespace is now on nightly. Not useful yet for anything, but that unblocks `on_type_error` and `on_unimplemented` to be implemented for non rustc usecases

> [2023-08-14 Triage Log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2023-08-14.md)

A light week. Main thing to report is we got some improvements from telling LLVM
that the negation in `<*const T>::sub` cannot overflow.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* This was specifically added to undo regressions flagged in PR #114604
* it did indeed undo the big changes: e.g. cranelift-codegen-0.82.1 had regressed by {2%, 1.7%}, and this improved it back by {-1.84%, -1.59%}
* likewise cargo-0.60.0 had improved by -0.93%, and this regressed it back by 0.99%. (I.e. we returned to prior status quo.)
* some other effects were not addressed by this PR, but they are all minor.
