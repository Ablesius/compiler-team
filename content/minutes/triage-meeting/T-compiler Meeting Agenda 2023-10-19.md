## Announcements

- [Compiler Team Planning meeting](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=MDJyYnJ1cGFtdWR1c2lnNjFmcHJ2b3JlODFfMjAyMzEwMjBUMTQwMDAwWiA2dTVycnRjZTZscnR2MDdwZmkzZGFtZ2p1c0Bn) at <time:2023-10-20T10:00:00-04:00>
- @**apiraino** proposal to rename the *WG-prioritization* to *T-compiler/ops* team ([Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/Rename.20.22WG-prioritization.22.20to.20.22T-compiler.2Fops.22)). Happy to receive feedback!
- Reminder: if you see a PR/issue that seems like there might be legal implications due to copyright/IP/etc, please let us know (or at least message @_**davidtwco** or @_**Wesley Wiser** so we can pass it along).

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2023-10-18](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2023-10-18.md)

Overall an interesting week performance wise, with small improvements to a vast
number of benchmarks seeming to outweigh an isolated set of (slightly) larger
regressions. It included a number of PRs regressed instruction counts but did
not matter for cycle times, plus one mysterious regression to `check_match` and
`mir_borrowck` from reworking constructor splitting (see report on PR 116391 for
details), and an awesome broad set of improvements from automatically inlining
small functions across crates (see report on PR 116505 for details).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* From skimming the PR, one can see that the PR author (RalfJung) iterated on this to identify a solution that would minimize regressions.
* As noted by the PR author, only secondary benchmarks were affected.
* Also, while instruction-counts regressed, the [cycle-counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a00c09e9d80b763fb29206b47b04e1d99c3ace96&end=e7bdc5f9f869219e8d20060b42a09ea10a837851&stat=cycles%3Au)
  did not, at least not enough to pass our noise threshold.
* marking as triaged.

* The try perf run had sole primary regression of unicode-normalization-0.1.19 opt-full (1.19%), while the perf run against master had sole primary regression of exa-0.10.1 opt-full (3.90%).
* The exa regression has persisted forward (i.e. it is not transient noise).
* It was already been marked as triaged, as the performance changes were deemed a wash, apart from object code sizes which saw "small but clear" improvement.

* sole regression was to secondary benchmark coercions debug incr-patched: add static arr item
* Looks like a blip (i.e. noise) based on the graph over time.
* marking as triaged

* the primary regressions were to cranelift-codegen-0.82.1 and cargo-0.60.0 in various incremental settings (mostly check builds)
* the large (>5%) secondary regressions are all to match-stress.
* the above cases were regressions for instruction-counts, but the cycle-counts didn't get marked as regressed in *any* of the same cases.
* in all cases, the performance loss from these regressions was subsequently recovered (or masked) by [PR 116505](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116505) "Automatically enable cross-crate inlining for small functions".
  (I don't know if that's actually related or just an awesome change that bought so much performance that it masked this problem).
* Since the match-stress one was relatively large, I looked at the
  self-profile results in the [details](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?commit=e20cb7702117f1ad8127a16406ba9edd230c4f65&benchmark=match-stress-check&scenario=full&base_commit=df4379b4eb5357263f0cf75475953f9b5c48c31f)
  which indicates a change in the delta(time) for match-stress might be due to new overheads in `check_match` and `mir_borrowck`.
* But this is strange; I cannot tell how this PR could have affected codegen, which would be the only way I could imagine those functions being impacted.
* Not marking as triaged for now; this mystery might be worth looking into a bit more. (But then again, the only significant regression was to a secondary stress test, so maybe its not worth spending time on.)
