## Working group sync

### [wg-nll](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/nll/)

- Rust 1.40 (current nightly) will be the first stable release without the HIR borrow checker.
This means Non Lexical Lifetimes will be available on Rust 2015.

- At this point, wg-nll has completed its purpose and will be disbanded.
  - wg-polonius is still going strong though!

### [wg-parallel-rustc](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/parallel-rustc/)

- Work is proceeding slowly but steadily.
There are regular triage meetings every Monday on the compiler calendar.

- The current goal is to refactor/audit compiler locks and other parts of the parallel query system and to investigate improving performance.

- The current MVP is to do high-level parallelization in a few critical places such as typechecking & linting.

- Currently, we're not seeing the speedups we want from parallelization but work is ongoing to remove locking and improve the jobserver integration.
