## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2022-08-24](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-08-24.md)

Overall some really impressive wins this week. Note in particular
PR [#100209](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100209), "Lazily
decode SourceFile from metadata" (which improved 75 primary benchmark
scenarios and 158 secondary scenarios) and
PR [#98655](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98655) "Don't derive
`PartialEq::ne`", which improved 65 primary scenarios and 27 secondary
scenarios). There were a few cases that pnkfelix explicitly decided not
to mark as triaged; see report for more details there.
Also pnkfelix wonders if there is a recent slight-upward trend on max-rss
for the past week, see the [summary graph](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=&end=&kind=percentfromfirst&stat=max-rss)

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* lqd hypothesized this was caused by PR #100652 "Remove deferred sized checks (make them eager)"
* regressions for #100652 include most of the rollup regressions, all by similar amounts (only ucd was absent from the narrower view).
* left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100652#issuecomment-1225798572) on PR #100652 and marked it as a regression; marked rollup as triaged.

rustc_metadata: dedupe strings to prevent multiple copies in rmeta/query cache blow file size [#98851](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98851) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0b79f758c9aa6646606662a6d623a0752286cd17&end=71ecf5d359bf750cc171e124779a46985633439d&stat=instructions:u)

| All  (primary)           | 0.6%  | [0.3%, 1.5%]   | 15    |

* the performance of this PR was heavily evaluated as part of its development.
* some regression to instruction counts is compensated for by the improvements file-size and to max-rss.
* the follow-up PR [#100803](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/100803) is going to more than compensate for the regressions here.
* marked as triaged.

* This PR was intended to be a refactor, but it turns out it has other problems (see [issue 100910](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/100910)).
* The regressions alone are not cause to revert the PR, but the soundness bug pushes me over the line.
* Nominated for discussion (of revert) in Thursday's T-compiler meeting. Not tagging as triaged.

* Don't get too excited y'all, that 19.6% improvement was to helloworld.
* having said that, this does represent a huge win across a broad suite of benchmarks, nearly all in incremental.
* (also, lqd notes that helloworld is a useful proxy for near-trivial build.rs scripts.)

* regressions were in regex-opt-incr-patched (and ucd-doc-full, but that was just 0.24%)
* while the regression here is unfortunate, there is not much we can expect to do in the short term to address it
* its not even clear whether miri is really at fault; the [detailed query](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?commit=31302033095dc75608675cd6f9b884d1692054f0&base_commit=4b695f7c4e1a02d160fe7e159abd0f87027c0fcf&benchmark=regex-1.5.5-opt&scenario=incr-patched:%20reverse) info says that the regression is due to `LLVM_lto_optimize`. Could the miri changes have somehow caused the codegen unit partitioning to change? Why would a miri update affect the time for `LLVM_lto_optimize`?
* not marking as triaged. I'm not sure if anyone can justify spending time to look at this, but I don't want to just let it slide through just yet.
