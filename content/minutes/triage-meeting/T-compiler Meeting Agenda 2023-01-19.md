### WG checkins

- Generic Associated Types initiative by @**Jack Huey** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/IvuR59rBR2Ka9opecmfaJQ#WG-checkins)):
  > Checkin text

- @_*WG-diagnostics* by @**Esteban KÃ¼ber** and @**oli** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/GTHhJzDrS26WZbIntmn55g#WG-checkins)):
  > * A bunch of old diagnostics issues was fixed in the last two months.
  > * We are testing the diagnostics output that users see in our ui test suite. Previously we tested the output if the libstd/libcore sources were available, which caused us to miss that some diagnostics were bad.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2023-01-18](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2023-01-18.md)

Nearly all flagged regressions are likely noise, except one rollup with minor
impact on diesel that we will follow up on. We had a broad (albeit small) win
from [#106294](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/106294).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
