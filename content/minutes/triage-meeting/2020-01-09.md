## Working group sync

### [wg-meta]

- Work is staring on forming a new "bisection ICE-breaker" group and a process for large compiler changes

### [wg-mir-opt]

- There's been [some discussion] on MIR 2.0

- [#67000] will finally make mir::Place not be able to point to statics or promoteds anymore but just locals

- [#67662] and [#67333] get us closer to bootstrapping rustc with mir inlining

- Const prop can now propagate into the rhs of assignments to user defined variables [#67130]
