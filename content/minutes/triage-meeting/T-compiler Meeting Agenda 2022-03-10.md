## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2022-03-09](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-03-09.md)

A pretty smooth week. All three regressions were small, and two were isolated to rustdoc alone.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [f0c4da49983aa699f715caf681e3154b445fb60b..10dccdc7fcbdc64ee9efe2c1ed975ab8c1d61287](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=f0c4da49983aa699f715caf681e3154b445fb60b&end=10dccdc7fcbdc64ee9efe2c1ed975ab8c1d61287&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 1 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
30 Untriaged Pull Requests
53 comparisons made in total

#### Regressions

Rollup of 9 pull requests [#94541](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94541)
- Arithmetic mean of relevant regressions: 1.5%
- Largest regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8769f4ef2fe1efddd1f072485f97f568e7328f79&end=2f8d1a835b4e7feaf625f74d0d5cb9b84dbc845a&stat=instructions:u): 3.9% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async check`
- After looking at the performance data, it seems like the regressions to `deeply-nested-async` are isolated to some [slowdown in `check_mod_privacy`](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?sort_idx=-11&commit=2f8d1a835b4e7feaf625f74d0d5cb9b84dbc845a&base_commit=8769f4ef2fe1efddd1f072485f97f568e7328f79&benchmark=deeply-nested-async-check&scenario=full).
- But AFAICT nothing in this rollup should have affected `check_mod_privacy`.
- Chalking this up to optimization noise; marked as triaged.

Support GATs in Rustdoc [#94009](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94009)
- Arithmetic mean of relevant regressions: 0.8%
- Largest regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=40d3040ae19b8c43c0027bc6d3e9805e5ee5e0ee&end=6d7684101a51f1c375ec84aef5d2fbdeb214bbc2&stat=instructions:u): 1.1% on `full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4 doc`
- Already marked as triaged by rustdoc team; this change makes rustdoc track more data, which inevitably leads to perf regressions.

rustdoc: Stop textually replacing `Self` in doc links before resolving them [#93805](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93805)
- Arithmetic mean of relevant regressions: 0.3%
- Arithmetic mean of all relevant changes: 0.3%
- Largest regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0cbef1c6a7f4ee33cd41d91778544c5399f10f39&end=1661e4c7e0e68b4297aec095064d80566d4ea2b1&stat=instructions:u): 1.0% on `full` builds of `serde doc`
- rustdoc team did not expect a regression here.
- it looks like collect-intra-doc-links got slower. not clear why, though.
- slowdown was solely observed in `serde doc`. posted some theories and marked as triaged.

#### Improvements

- remove obligation dedup from `impl_or_trait_obligations` [#84944](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84944)
- Introduce `ConstAllocation`. [#94597](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94597)
- Rollup of 6 pull requests [#94761](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94761)

#### Mixed

Reopen 91719 [#94570](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94570)
- Arithmetic mean of relevant regressions: 0.5%
- Arithmetic mean of relevant improvements: -1.4%
- Arithmetic mean of all relevant changes: -1.0%
- Largest improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=047f9c4bc4e26df4f54c3c76af3e963782ed05e4&end=b4bf56cd66ca83e908fd43bde4c627f94b2a8a9f&stat=instructions:u): -6.9% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async check`
- Largest regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=047f9c4bc4e26df4f54c3c76af3e963782ed05e4&end=b4bf56cd66ca83e908fd43bde4c627f94b2a8a9f&stat=instructions:u): 1.3% on `incr-full` builds of `piston-image opt`
- Already [triaged by workingjubilee](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94570#issuecomment-1058879131) when they r+'ed it.
