# T-compiler Meeting Agenda 2021-11-11

[Tracking Issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54818)

## Announcements

- Reminder: if you see a PR/issue that seems like there might be legal implications due to copywrite/IP/etc, please let the Core team know (or at least message @_**pnkfelix** or @_**Wesley Wiser** so we can pass it along).
  - A new PR has been filed to include the Playstation Vita as tier 3 target. [This comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90584#issuecomment-963675057) suggests the situation could be similar to other end-of-life proprietary platforms. @**Josh Triplett** provided tips for an MCP
- @**Hans Kratz** is gathering interest around the macOS target platform and build a notification group who can respond to issues, [see Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/233931-t-compiler.2Fmajor-changes/topic/Create.20a.20macos.20notification.20group.20compiler-team.23470).

### WG checkins

@_WG-self-profile_ from @**mw** and @**Wesley Wiser** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/eviBs_qISRC9mlDve0cSRQ?view#WG-checkins)):

> The compiler can record artifact sizes (e.g. size of object files, rlibs, incr. comp. cache, etc) now and will do so by default when invoking it with -Zself-profile. The summarize tool will display these artifact sizes in a separate table. @rylev is working hard on also showing them on perf.rlo -- which turned out to be a little more tricky than expected but we'll get there `:)`This will be very useful for gauging the impact a PR might have on binary sizes and the like.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-11-09](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-11-09.md)

Largely a positive week despite taking a significant performance hit from turning on incremental compilation verification for a subsection of the total queries that the compiler does in order to more quickly catch bugs in incremental compilation. Luckily optimizations in bidi detection brought large performance improvements.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

#### Regressions

Implement `RefUnwindSafe` for `Rc<T>` [#87467](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87467)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0b4ac62ddaf9ee01b8aaf9dd7097f1f541d64551&end=4061c0407978a00c5c2518d898ad8406da28c106&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.1% on `full` builds of `cargo`)
- Unsurprising regression in one instance of a rustdoc run since `get_auto_trait_impls` has bad algoritmic complexity. This issue is being tracked somewhat [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90512).

Enable verification for 1/32th of queries loaded from disk [#90361](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90361)

- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3e3890c9d4064253aaa8c51f5d5458d2dc6dab77&end=495322d776fd6f679cd8cd4ca02b8fa834da654b&stat=instructions:u) (up to 6.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `coercions`)
- Allows for verification of incremental compilation results to more easily catch bugs (which have unfortunately been a bit too common in the past).
- As noted in the PR this is a regression of at most 7% on coercions opt incr-unchanged, and typically less than 0.5% on other benchmarks (largely limited to incr-unchanged).
- The PR author and reviewer reviewed the regression impact and it was deemed acceptable.

#### Improvements

- Optimize bidi character detection. [#90559](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90559)
- Fix ICE when rustdoc is scraping examples inside of a proc macro [#90583](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90583)
- Replace some uses of vec.drain(..) with vec.into_iter() [#90655](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90655)
- rustdoc: Cleanup `clean::Impl` and other parts of `clean` [#90675](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90675)

#### Mixed

rustdoc: Add `DocVisitor` and use it where possible [#90475](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90475)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=baba6687df3e83fdb15cc6ec239b4a1c75a30505&end=4ff90232a0c0c6adb9d2052da2206b26c3c723e4&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.8% on `full` builds of `serde`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=baba6687df3e83fdb15cc6ec239b4a1c75a30505&end=4ff90232a0c0c6adb9d2052da2206b26c3c723e4&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.5% on `full` builds of `webrender`)
- The regressions have [already been justified](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90475#issuecomment-959808629), but in short the improvements outweigh the regressions, and the code is much cleaner as a result.

Improve error when an .rlib can't be parsed [#88368](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88368)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=46b8e7488eae116722196e8390c1bd2ea2e396cf&end=5fa94f3c57e27a339bc73336cd260cd875026bd1&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.3% on `full` builds of `externs`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=46b8e7488eae116722196e8390c1bd2ea2e396cf&end=5fa94f3c57e27a339bc73336cd260cd875026bd1&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- It was pointed out that this could be simply due to a different binary layout impacting performance.
- When taking into account significance factor, the improvements outweigh the regressions, and so it's likely not worth it to investigate deeper.

Rollup of 4 pull requests [#90695](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90695)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=515472757d2991e280965d7c1d235cfbb6ceb006&end=c57704f3eb4319cc93513c232e9c434a73af46d2&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.5% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=515472757d2991e280965d7c1d235cfbb6ceb006&end=c57704f3eb4319cc93513c232e9c434a73af46d2&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `html5ever`)
- Nothing jumps out as a possible cause for this but luckily the perf changes in question are small.

Don't destructure args tuple in format_args! [#90485](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90485)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c57704f3eb4319cc93513c232e9c434a73af46d2&end=60952bc3da442cf2ea11dcc9c80a461a659bbcd7&stat=instructions:u) (up to -4.0% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `inflate`)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c57704f3eb4319cc93513c232e9c434a73af46d2&end=60952bc3da442cf2ea11dcc9c80a461a659bbcd7&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.3% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `html5ever`)
- The regressions seem to be coming in `expand_crate` which might be impacted by this change. However, nothing stands out immediately as a definite cause for concern.
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90485#issuecomment-964330008) for the author and reviewer to ask if they have an ideas before we investigate more.
