### WG checkins

- @_*WG-llvm* by @**nagisa** and @**Nikita Popov** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/Q16ULE5gQG6embjLHEFREg#WG-checkins)):
  > * @**Patrick Walton** has done some investigations into memcpy elimination and proposed a new transform in https://reviews.llvm.org/D140089. The big LLVM memcpy eliminator patch is up â€” 17% reduction in Rust memcpys now, with up to 42% possible in the future with more MIR optimization work.

  > LLVM 16 is expected to branch Jan 24, so we'll be starting the LLVM 16 upgrade around that time. A key blocker on the Rust side is the mingw-w64 upgrade (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100178).

  > Note from @_**apiraino**: mingw-w64 upgrade was nominated for a [previous meeting](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202022-11-10/near/309020772) ("to consider the compatibility aspect, at least"). If `T-compiler` if fine with the upgrade, it might be good to explicit that so nobody feels this is blocked on some decision.

- Types team by @**nikomatsakis** and @**Jack Huey** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/Q16ULE5gQG6embjLHEFREg#WG-checkins)):
  > We had an in-person meetup Nov. 30th - Dec. 2nd. We discussed a bunch of things like: types-y tracking issues; unsound issues; some "end user" features and how we get there; roadmap for short, medium, long-term; and a planning for the trait solver rewrite/refactor.
  > We're planing to write a blog post "officially" announcing the team, some of things we've accomplished since forming, and our roadmap and goals.
  > We're on pause for meetings for the holidays.

## Performance logs

Fairly quiet week with the only excitement coming from a nice improvement implemented by @nnethercote which fixed a pesky performance regressions in the linting system. This produced a 0.6% performance improvement across a large amount of the real world crates we test against. 

Triage done by **@rylev**.

#### Regressions

Rollup of 9 pull requests [#105378](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105378) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e60fbaf4ce768d13a6abc048bd34ee12995d18dc&end=b28d30e1e3c2b90fd08b7dd79d8e63884d1e0339&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | -     | -              | 0     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 1.9%  | [0.2%, 4.4%]   | 12    |
| Improvements (primary)   | -     | -              | 0     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -0.8% | [-0.8%, -0.8%] | 1     |
| All  (primary)           | -     | -              | 0     |
- Suspicion is that [#105250](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105250) is the cause. Running a regression test to confirm.
- This is small enough that it's not worth stressing about.


Fast-path some binder relations [#105350](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105350) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=71ec1457ee9868a838e4521a3510cdd416c0c295&end=109cccbe4f345c0f0785ce860788580c3e2a29f5&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean | range        | count |
|:------------------------:|:----:|:------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 1.1% | [1.0%, 1.2%] | 2     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 2.3% | [2.0%, 2.7%] | 6     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -    | -            | 0     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -    | -            | 0     |
| All  (primary)           | 1.1% | [1.0%, 1.2%] | 2     |
- This is noise. The regression cancel out the improvements in the exact same test cases from the previous commit which is a very strong indicator that this is noise.


#### Improvements

- A single tiny regression on a doc profiler, not worth worrying about. ([commented here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105486#issuecomment-1344956405))

- The regressions is small in absolute terms, only in instructions count, it's a short stress test that doesn't seem to be the only one to exercize some codepath changed in this PR. Nothing jumps out in the rolled up PRs nor seems to apply to the other benchmarks. There are also small wins elsewhere, so this seems fine. ([commented here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105512#issuecomment-1345337596))

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "Android NDK r25b changes will break developers using r22b or older" [rust#103673](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103673) 
  - Nominated by @**tmandry** ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103673#issuecomment-1343706914)), basically needs someone driving the FCP mentioned in [previous meeting](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202022-11-10/near/309021929)
  - [draft blog post](https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/1055) announcing the NDK min. version update
- "Temporarily disable building rustc with ThinLTO on `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`" [rust#105662](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105662)
  - ThinLTO on by default seems to "regress the message we print during ICEs sometimes, including the query stack and explanation on how to open a GH issue"
  - T-compiler to review: should we proceed and disable ThinLTO on CI temporarily also for linux+windows targets? 

[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)
- No nominated RFCs for `T-compiler` this time.
