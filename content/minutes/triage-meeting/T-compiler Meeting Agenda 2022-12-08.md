## Performance logs

A mixed bag of a week. 2 of the 3 regressions are connected to changes to the
query system that underlies incremental compilation. The third regression is
still being investigated. For all three, the impact on cycle counts that are
within our noise tolerance levels There were several small-ish improvements,
though PR #104963 is worth calling out: a well-factored change to
how we lower the AST into HIR that had a broad positive impact. One final
note: the summary-opt max-rss seems to gone up by 1.5% over the past month
([perf](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=2022-11-06&end=2022-12-06&kind=percentfromfirst&stat=max-rss)),
via a gradual climb; just something to keep our eyes on going forward.

* Many primary benchmarks regressed, but the regression is contained solely to incremental builds, and the magnitude is also well-contained.
* [oli-obk investigated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104940#issuecomment-1333435955) and determined that
  the bulk of the regression is time spent in try_mark_previous_green and incremental_verify_ich calls.
* The impact on cycle-counts (rather than instruction counts) was well within noise tolerance levels.
* Therefore, marked as triaged.

* the original timer run said [this had no problem](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105220#issuecomment-1336312355)
* (though to be fair, I don't know what changes occurred to the commit series between that timer run and what landed)
* oli-obk investigated and found [cachegrind shows this to be artifacts from inlining decisions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105220#issuecomment-1338942653)
* The impact on cycle-counts (rather than instruction counts) was well within noise tolerance levels.
* Therefore, marked as triaged.
