# T-compiler Meeting Agenda 2023-11-30

## Announcements

- RFC: improve the onboarding experience of t-compiler + t-compiler-contributor ([Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/244344-t-compiler.2Fcontrib-private/topic/Welcoming.20new.20members.20in.20t-compiler-contributors)):
  - HackMD document: https://hackmd.io/Cp0Ktm2KQeS4TNmFn2UwWQ
  - @_**Santiago Pastorino** @_**lqd**  and _@_**apiraino** are planning to work a bit on the rustc-dev + forge documentation as well
  - ðŸ‘‰ Feedback and wishlists around this topic are welcome!
- Reminder: if you see a PR/issue that seems like there might be legal implications due to copyright/IP/etc, please let us know (or at least message @_**davidtwco** or @_**Wesley Wiser** so we can pass it along).

### P-critical

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-compiler)
- "Miscompilation of Bevy (and some wgpu) apps resulting in segfault on macOS." [rust#117902](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/117902)
  - Actually will be fixed by fixing the `wgpu` crate ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/117902#issuecomment-1831027066) and following)
- "1.74 causes an internal compiler error: broken MIR in Item" [rust#117976](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/117976)
  - stable Regression is causing the project `tantivy` to fail compiling on 1.74. Reported problems also from a Asahi Linux kernel driver ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/117976#issuecomment-1822225691))
  - @**lqd** investigated and reports that it doesn't reproduce anymore on nightly+beta ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/117976#issuecomment-1815237421)). We probably just missed a backport.

[T-types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-types)
- No `P-critical` issues for `T-types` this time.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2023-11-28](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/20911b7f28a4b88d36ecd5b13414f26feac49d4d/triage/2023-11-28.md)

A good week, despite a few PRs that pnkfelix opted not to mark as triaged. In
particular, a broad set of primary benchmarks improved, due to improvements to
resolve (PR #118188) and a one-pass rewrite of exhaustiveness (PR #117611).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [4f3da903..df0295f0](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=4f3da903a43f22ea33d2ca4435a24b42fc1f842a&end=df0295f07175acc7325ce3ca4152eb05752af1f2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

1 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
84 artifact comparisons made in total

#### Regressions

Rollup of 4 pull requests [#118319](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118319) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3dbb4da04267b19bc8c403c0bb2b41c5b8010a61&end=3bb0171999a65b0650d9405a7b2e8e7dc3476dec&stat=instructions:u)

* The bulk (in this case > 0.31%) of the primary regressions are to bitmaps and libc, in a variety of incremental modes.
* nnethercote noted that this seems like it must be PR #118311 ("merge DefKind::Coroutine into Defkind::Closure"), and confirmed it by benchmarking that specific commit.
* follow-up PR's have been proposed, but we have not successfully found one that undoes the regression.
* meanwhile, a follow-on PR, #118188, has landed that is coupled to #118311. This PR #118188 seems to have wide benefits. So it may not be worthwhile to spend time trying to figure out the regression injected by #118311.
* not marking as triaged yet.

#### Improvements

* wide range of benchmarks improved on incr-unchanged and incr-patched variants: stm32f4, diesel, bitmaps, cranelift-codegen, syn, serde, et cetera.
* as noted above with #118319, this is coupled with a PR (#118311) associated with some regressions.

* The single primary regression here seems to be a measurement blip, based on the 30-day history.
* Even if it weren't, the improvements would outweigh the regression.
* Marked as triaged.

* primary improvements were to html5ever, cranelift-codegen, exa, and image.
* unicode-normalization was the main primary regression, by up to 1.15% (check incr-full); but its worth noting that it was very close to the significance factor (1.13%) for that benchmark, so its borderline historically.
* already marked as triaged by nnethercote
