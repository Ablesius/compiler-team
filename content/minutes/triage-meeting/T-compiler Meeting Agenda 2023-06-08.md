- @_*WG-rls2.0* by @**Lukas Wirth** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/KZoEURJsQPaQtTg0gyHnIg#WG-checkins)):
  > We actually noticed an interesting issue. rust-analyzer now depends on the rustc_abi crate for layout calculations (required for const eval and as well as some IDE features). It is important for this crate as our dependency to be in sync with the current toolchain such that we don't analysize things incorrectly depending on the layout that would mismatch what the current rustc thinks. The problem here is, that upstream rust-analyzer usually targets the latest stable rust for which we can be in sync manually on the master branch, but the problem arises when considering the rustup component now. Our subtree syncs target the latest rust-analyzer master branch which targets the latest released stable, and as such any beta branches (and therefore future stable releases) will sometimes be guruanteed to mismatch. We aren't sure how to tackle this problem yet unfortunately (this is very similar to the proc-macro abi problems we had in the past intersetingly enough), related tracking issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/14846

## Performance logs

This week was a bunch of improvements, largely driven by cutting std debuginfo
in [#110221] and a few MIR or codegen optimizations. No pure regressions landed
this week!

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [1221e43bdf413f7c405e9b17ef19d76c88222098..adc719d7147d5e2578ce08e0b4504be44650256e](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1221e43bdf413f7c405e9b17ef19d76c88222098&end=adc719d7147d5e2578ce08e0b4504be44650256e&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

#### Regressions

No regressions this week.

#### Improvements

Greatly decrease the size of `rustc_driver.so` when debuginfo is enabled [#110221](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110221) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=51f714c8c5021fe25442e46798b1cbef2f2249ed&end=42f28f9eb41adb7a197697e5e2d6535d00fd0f4a&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range           | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | -     | -               | 0     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | -     | -               | 0     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -8.8% | [-17.6%, -0.5%] | 17    |
| Improvements (secondary) | -7.5% | [-17.2%, -0.2%] | 72    |
| All  (primary)           | -8.8% | [-17.6%, -0.5%] | 17    |

This PR compresses and cuts some debuginfo from the shipped std library,
somewhat unintentionally. This might be something we roll back if we get
regression reports about it - not clear whether this changes behavior in a
meaningful way for anyone.

#### Mixed

Rollup of 6 pull requests [#112016](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112016) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=786178b2ab79ae471c5efc4e1faa0c83b9151703&end=82b311b4189cce2bde455f3e091ae662a382d592&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.5%  | [0.2%, 1.0%]   | 14    |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.3%  | [0.3%, 0.5%]   | 6     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -0.7% | [-1.1%, -0.3%] | 2     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -0.5% | [-0.5%, -0.5%] | 1     |
| All  (primary)           | 0.3%  | [-1.1%, 1.0%]  | 16    |

Roughly scattered changes, many of which are in high-variance benchmarks.

Enable MatchBranchSimplification [#112001](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112001) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ddad0576caf8d0515ed453e04b468977c7d3dfc1&end=f59d577838fb0449a2b59ec3525a7fa91509e861&stat=instructions:u)

|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.5%  | [0.3%, 0.7%]   | 5     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.6%  | [0.2%, 0.8%]   | 10    |
| Improvements (primary)   | -0.3% | [-0.4%, -0.2%] | 4     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -0.3% | [-0.3%, -0.3%] | 1     |
| All  (primary)           | 0.2%  | [-0.4%, 0.7%]  | 9     |

Scattered changes, mostly a wash. Optimization targets particular code patterns
which don't occur that often in rustc most likely.

MIR: opt-in normalization of `BasicBlock` and `Local` numbering [#111813](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111813) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1c53407e8c7cc922d718bde61ca34f47b6d2120f&end=089677eb32af83318467325edbef9b64053df532&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.3%  | [0.3%, 0.3%]   | 1     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.7%  | [0.3%, 1.2%]   | 8     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -     | -              | 0     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -1.0% | [-1.5%, -0.3%] | 7     |
| All  (primary)           | 0.3%  | [0.3%, 0.3%]   | 1     |

Mostly noise, probably. The new normalization is off by default.

Inline derived `hash` [#111963](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111963) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=089677eb32af83318467325edbef9b64053df532&end=f8447b963893b410f1dbce2cd752a898dc3ed8d4&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.3%  | [0.3%, 0.3%]   | 1     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.5%  | [0.2%, 0.6%]   | 15    |

| All  (primary)           | -0.2% | [-0.6%, 0.3%]  | 17    |

Improvements outweigh regressions.

Use `Cow` in `{D,Subd}iagnosticMessage`. [#111748](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111748) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dc0943d2eebf139e7e509882b803f77bfd25656d&end=70e04bd88d85cab8ed110ace5a278fab106d0ef5&stat=instructions:u)

| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.7%  | [0.6%, 0.8%]   | 5     |

| All  (primary)           | -     | -              | 0     |

Regressions limited to secondary benchmarks, and a good portion of them are
bimodal benchmarks. No further investigation warranted.

Make `TrustedStep` require `Copy` [#112083](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112083) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=45eec0fe931e02932b43b79c51f90050c973c690&end=578bcbc2b42191556c4438b80ba37fafa4193e82&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.2%  | [0.2%, 0.2%]   | 1     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.5%  | [0.2%, 0.7%]   | 5     |

| Improvements (secondary) | -1.2% | [-3.5%, -0.4%] | 13    |
| All  (primary)           | -0.4% | [-1.1%, 0.2%]  | 2     |

Improvements clearly outweigh regressions.

move `super_relate_consts` hack to `normalize_param_env_or_error` [#111623](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111623) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=617d3d6d722c432cdcbf210e6db55c3bdeafe381&end=e29821ff85a2a3000d226f99f62f89464028d5d6&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.3%  | [0.2%, 0.6%]   | 8     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | -     | -              | 0     |

| All  (primary)           | 0.2%  | [-0.3%, 0.6%]  | 10    |

Most likely inlining or other codegen changes; roughly neutral change overall.

SROA benefits cranelift codegen and has no significant impact on runtimes, so
enabling by default makes sense. It also helps with MatchBranchSimplification,
enabled in a separate PR.

More MIR opt enablement -- some regressions here, but improvements are much
more wide-ranging than the regressions.

Possibly just noise/bimodality given benchmarks and lack of significant PRs in
this rollup. Not investigating further.

Only check inlining counter after recursing. [#112240](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112240) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d8095acb5f8134cbff59b2cc8c8b7f5cec364280&end=9eee230cd0a56bfba3ce65121798d9f9f4341cdd&stat=instructions:u)

Changes in inlining, overall a positive despite a few regressions.

No clear impact on rustc workloads, but may benefit others.
