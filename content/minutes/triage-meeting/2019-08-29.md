## Working group sync

### [wg-mir-opt](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/mir-opt/)

- [@spastorino](https://github.com/spastorino) has gotten Place 2.0 (a reimagining of `mir::Place` using slices for projections) with only a slight regression in memory usage on one compiler benchmark.
  - They're currently working on fixing that regression.
  
- [@wesleywiser](https://github.com/wesleywiser) split promoted items out of `mir::Body` to prevent cycles in the optimization pipeline.
  - They're continuing to work on making the `const_prop` pass more powerful.

### [wg-parallel-rustc](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/parallel-rustc/)

- [@aturon](https://github.com/aturon) is doing an audit of related PRs (accepted and pending) with a focus on shared state and lock semantics with multithreaded rustc.

- [@aturon](https://github.com/aturon) is also going to be working on reducing locking and shared mutable state that exists outside the query system.
