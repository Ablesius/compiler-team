## Working group sync

### [wg-pgo](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/pgo/)

- PGO is available in the stable compiler. Docs are in the rustc-guide and the rustc-book

- Unfortunately we don't observe significant performance gains from applying it (except for tiny synthetic test cases).

- [@michaelwoerister] asked for people to try PGO on irlo but haven't gotten a lot of feedback.

- There is one interesting theory that Rust doesn't profit as much as C++ because it defaults to having fewer compilation units and thus can make better inlining decisions in the non-PGO case.

- The working group will probably wind down as [@michaelwoerister] don't have time to pursue further and there are no actual known issues in the implementation.

### [wg-pipelining](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/pipelining/)
