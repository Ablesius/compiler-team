### [wg-parallel-rustc]

- Posted an [Internals thread] to gather feedback from users trying out the parallel compiler build

- [@joshtriplett] has done some profiling on a 72 core machine which may have revealed a deadlock and some scalability issues, which they'll be looking into

- The current overall plan is to evaluate the performance and other reports on the internals thread, and then likely move forward on shipping the parallel compiler early in the new year with the default thread count still capped at 4
