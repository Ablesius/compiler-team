# Working group sync

## [wg-polonius](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/polonius/)

- After a long hiatus, this working group is being rebooted with a focus on expanding [Polonius](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius) coverage to include initialization checking and region subtyping in addition to borrow checking.

- Work is also proceceeding on a book which will document the rules for Polonius. The hope is this will both make it easier to understand Polonius and also help make it easier for new contributors to get involved.

- [@Albin Stjerna](https://github.com/albins) is also working on a master's thesis which overlaps with the Polonius work.

- [@Aaron Weiss](https://github.com/aatxe) and [@nikomatsakis](https://github.com/nikomatsakis) realized that there maybe opportunities to make Polonius more precise. [Related video chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAUGvNgZYtw&list=PL85XCvVPmGQitE2CBzf-gERSqeXo59NQG&index=4&t=0s)

- [@lqd](https://github.com/lqd) has been working on a rustc compare mode which will check Polonius against the current borrow checker.

- [@Matthew Jasper](https://github.com/matthewjasper) has made a number of fixes and cleanups so nearly all of the rustc tests pass under Polonius.

- Some general performance work has been done but there's more to do especially around large constants.

- Some vocabularly is also being decided on.

## [wg-rfc-2229](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rfc-2229/)

- [RFC 2229](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2229-capture-disjoint-fields.md) changes closures so they don't capture entire variables, but rather subpaths.

- [@blitzerr](https://github.com/blitzerr) has been working on a refactoring related to how closure substitutions work. This is mostly done but it's hit some issues related to diagnostics and needs also needs to be rebased.

- Work is ongoing.
