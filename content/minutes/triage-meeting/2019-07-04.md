# 2019-07-04

## Volunteers wanted

- No issues discussed this week.

## Backport decisions

- There were no backport nominations this week.

## Working group sync

[wg-meta](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/content/docs/working-groups/meta/_index.md)

- Conferences, Mozilla All-Hands, and other activities have been keeping members of the group busy recently.
So there's been a slight stall in activity.

- The compiler team website is nearly completed thanks to @Federico Carrone and @catalinasy!

## Meta

A [poll was taken](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/weekly.20meeting.202019-07-04.20.2354818/near/169652882) to see if there was interest in moving the Friday Compiler Steering Meeting to another day or time.
Most people didn't have a strong feeling one way or the other.
