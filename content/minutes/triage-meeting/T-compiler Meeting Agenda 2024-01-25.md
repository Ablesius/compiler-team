## Performance logs

> [triage logs 2024-01-23](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/16f2ce47ea1b2e10ba0c969b2d5e1d714fea517f/triage/2024-01-23.md)

This week saw a bunch of regressions caused by correctness fixes and in general doing more work
in the compiler. These were offset by many improvements (especially around hashing in the compiler)
that improved performance by ~2% across a large number of benchmarks. Don't get too excited about the
large 45+% wins though, these were only for tiny benchmarks like helloworld. They were caused by a
[change in Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13257) which introduces stripping of debug
symbols from Rust release binaries by default, and in turn also improves compilation time for small
crates.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [f9c2421a..d6b151fc](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=f9c2421a2a6e34f3756900dd7d600704c08bfccb&end=d6b151fc77e213bf637db0f12c1965ace3ffe255&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

| All  (primary)           | 0.3% | [0.2%, 0.5%] | 26    |

* This was a correctness fix that had an expected performance hit.

Rollup of 8 pull requests [#120187](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120187) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=867d39cdf625e4db4b381faff993346582e598b4&end=cb25c5bc3d526a8fb931314cb3a7849115134b04&stat=instructions:u)

| All  (primary)           | 0.5% | [0.3%, 1.0%] | 8     |

* This was a mixture of several PRs that had a perf. effect.
* [#119461](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/119461) and [#118811](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118811)
slightly regressed the `deep-vector` benchmark, which was however quite noisy recently, so it was
probably just a blip.
* [#116090](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116090) caused a real regression on `doc`
benchmarks, which was caused simply by adding a bunch of new methods to the standard library.

Rollup of 8 pull requests [#120196](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120196) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a58ec8ff03b3269b20104eb7eae407be48ab95a7&end=6fff796eac247c072ddb84f8202bedecc8e94f0d&stat=instructions:u)

* Caused by [#120145](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120145), which was a correctness fix,
so marked as triaged.

Rollup of 10 pull requests [#120242](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120242) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=021861aea8de20c76c7411eb8ada7e8235e3d9b5&end=d5fd0997291ca0135401a39dff25c8a9c13b8961&stat=instructions:u)

* Caused by [#120137](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120137), which added more validation
to the compiler, and the perf. hit was deemed acceptable, so marked as triaged.

#### Improvements

Cache local DefId-keyed queries without hashing [#119977](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/119977) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=92f2e0aa62113a5f31076a9414daca55722556cf&end=098d4fd74c078b12bfc2e9438a2a04bc18b393bc&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.7%  | [0.7%, 0.7%]   | 1     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | -     | -              | 0     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -1.2% | [-8.2%, -0.2%] | 161   |
| Improvements (secondary) | -1.5% | [-3.7%, -0.3%] | 64    |
| All  (primary)           | -1.2% | [-8.2%, 0.7%]  | 162   |

* Incredible wins across many benchmarks, caused by improving hashing in the compiler.
* The wall-time results of this PR were even more [impressive](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=92f2e0aa62113a5f31076a9414daca55722556cf&end=098d4fd74c078b12bfc2e9438a2a04bc18b393bc&stat=wall-time), resulting in a ~4% mean improvement across more than a hundred benchmark
configurations!

Get rid of the hir_owner query. [#120006](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120006) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=25f8d01fd8bda339612d0c0a8844173a09205f7c&end=d3c9082a44f00b22152ebc9c92c129b10ccb7793&stat=instructions:u)

| Regressions (primary)    | -     | -              | 0     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.3%  | [0.2%, 0.4%]   | 3     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -1.8% | [-5.5%, -0.3%] | 129   |
| Improvements (secondary) | -2.1% | [-4.4%, -0.4%] | 46    |
| All  (primary)           | -1.8% | [-5.5%, -0.3%] | 129   |

* Again, great wins across a lot of benchmarks.

* Several nice wins on larger benchmarks, overall the wins outweighed the losses.

* This new lint introduced more tracking of spans in the compiler, which expectedly
slightly regressed compile times. It is expected that the new spans will be used
by future lints/errors to provide better diagnostics.

* A few tiny regressions, but there's not much to be done about these since this
was a Cargo update.
* The large instruction count improvements came from https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13257,
which introduced stripping of `--release` binaries by default. This coincidentally also reduces
linking time on Linux quite a lot for tiny programs, which caused these improvements on
`helloworld`-like crates.

* Regressions have outweighted the improvements here, however, this was a correctness fix,
so we will have to take the hit. A part of the regressions reverted wins from
[#120123](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120123).

* This was caused by [#120037](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120037), which
seems to have just undone a previous perf. win on the same benchmarks caused by
code being reshuffled around.

* It introduced a few Max-RSS regressions, which were later fixed in
[#120080](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120080).
