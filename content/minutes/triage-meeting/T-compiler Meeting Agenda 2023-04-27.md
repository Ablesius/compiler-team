## Performance logs

A week mostly dominated by noise, in particular a persistent bimodality in
keccak and cranelift-codegen. No significant changes outside of that, a
relatively equal mix of regressions and improvements. Most of the bimodality
has been removed below as it's just noise.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

This PR also bumped std dependencies, which likely explains the additional compile time cost in our smallest benchmarks (e.g., helloworld).

Per [comment on the PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110107#issuecomment-1501563158) this is enabling lints to run on dead code, expected regression.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "const-propagated `arithmetic_overflow` in unreachable code" [rust#109731](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/109731)
  - briefly touched in [previous meeting](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202023-04-13/near/349134541)
  - nominated by Wesley ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/109731#issuecomment-1516469403)) to keep the discussion focus whether this could be considered a regression or not, possibly documenting it. Taking a decision Before it reaches stable (now in beta)
  - @**jyn** comments:
  > I don't think we should try to warn on unreachable code, it seems ok to silence the lint there. I just don't think we should treat it as a regression and breaking change. This is a lint and not a hard error for a reason.

[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- No I-compiler-nominated RFCs this time.
