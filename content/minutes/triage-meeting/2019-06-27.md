# 2019-06-27

The meeting largely consisted of discussion of a few nominated issues:

- [Rustdoc recursion limit issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62059)
  - Assigned to @nagisa

- [Incorrect span / broken rustfix: help: use dyn: dyn #[dom_struct]](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61963)
  - @davidtwco is assigned and working on a fix.

- [Soundness hole in pattern matching on enums with an uninhabited variant](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61696)
  - Assigned to @eddyb.

- [Self as default type isnt typechecked](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61631)
  - Under discussion at a future T-Lang meeting.

- [Incremental compilation results in linker error when method use is removed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59535)
  - Assigned to @Zoxc tentatively as @mw is on leave.

- [Coherence can be bypassed by an indirect impl for a trait object](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)
  - Assigned to @centril and it has a T-Lang meeting slot.

- [The compiler should report publicly exported type names if possible](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21934)
  - There was some discussion about why this is difficult currently and possible approaches to resolving this issue.
  - No firm conclusion was reached so the nomination label was left on the issue and it can be picked back up next week.
  
- ["immutable field" errors are confusing when the handle is mutable, should describe why it is immutable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18150)
  - This issue is `P-high` for WG-diagnostics but not necessarily the entire compiler team.
