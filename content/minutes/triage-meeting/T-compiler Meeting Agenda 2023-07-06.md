### WG checkins

@_*WG-llvm* by @**nagisa** and @**Nikita Popov**([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/jG2Ea1RxQJuQye5kIiiHkA#WG-checkins)):
  > * LLVM 17 branches in about three weeks, which is when we'll start with the update in Rust as well.
 > * After much nagging from T-opsem, we've changed getelementptr inbounds semantics to always allow zero offsets.
 > * cbeuw has been fuzzing Rust and finding lots of miscompiles on the LLVM side, which I've been working on fixing.

Types team by @**nikomatsakis** and @**Jack Huey** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/8Wy81OhVQ06VG2px9R1eSA#WG-checkins)):
  > Progress continues. We've set up a weekly "solver meeting", essentially a deep dive into the new trait solver, a-mir-formality, polonius, etc. Also planning to have an in-person meetup around EuroRust.
