### P-high regressions

[P-high beta regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-beta+label%3AP-high+-label%3AT-infra+-label%3AT-libs+-label%3AT-libs-api+-label%3AT-release+-label%3AT-rustdoc+-label%3AT-core)
- No `P-high` beta regressions this time.

[Unassigned P-high nightly regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-nightly+label%3AP-high+no%3Aassignee+-label%3AT-infra+-label%3AT-libs+-label%3AT-libs-api+-label%3AT-release+-label%3AT-rustdoc+-label%3AT-core+)
- "Severe perf regression in optimized debug builds due to extra UB checks" [rust#121245](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/121245)
  - @**apiraino** assigned P-high given it's reported as a /severe/ perf. regression in Miri built with optimized and debug assertions. Open to re-assess priority.
  - reported that disabling one of the UB checks introduced in #120594 gives a speedup of the same ballpark as that slowdown
  - [last perf. run](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/120594#issuecomment-1936402227) on #120594 were mostly positive :thinking:

## Performance logs

Relatively few PRs affecting performance, but massive improvements thanks to the
update to LLVM 18 (PR #12005), as well as the merging of two related compiler
queries (PR #120919) and other small improvements from a rollup (PR #121055).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [74c3f5a1..5af21304](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=74c3f5a146860c94ff4d179fc3bfa34f879adf41&end=5af2130440c198afefbe5b8099342057cf272ef4&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

* regressions are [explained by petrochenkov](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/117772#issuecomment-1951430297): This lint is newly firing against benchmark code, which means that lint reporting machinery is being exercised that was previously not being exercised.
* marked as triaged and filed rust-lang/rustc-perf#1819 to follow up with potential counter-action in benchmark tooling.

* Instruction count regressions flagged against serde_derive, diesel, serde, html5ever, syn
* Most of these were anticipated in the final perf runs against the try builds.
* Marking as triaged under assumption that the reviewers deemed this change to be worth the predicted cost.
