## Performance logs

> [triage logs 2023-03-14](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2023-03-14.md)

A fairly mixed week, with several significant improvements and a few
significant regressions. On average, this week saw a slight increase in compile
times.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

Noise, most likely, based on small deltas. Marked as triaged.

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.6%  | [0.2%, 1.2%]   | 93    |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 1.1%  | [0.2%, 2.9%]   | 45    |

Regressions largely resolved in
[#109057](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109057); essentially all
regressions are to incremental workloads.

| All  (primary)           | 0.8% | [0.8%, 0.9%] | 3     |

Minor regressions in incremental scenarios for a few workloads; not concerning
enough to warrant further investigation.
