## Working group sync

### [wg-mir-opt](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/mir-opt/)

- [@wesleywiser] Moved promoted MIR out of `mir::Body` [#63580](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/63580)
- [@wesleywiser] Reimplemented the `ConstProp` optimization pass on top of the existing const eval code [#64419](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64419)
- [@spastorino] Converted `mir::Place` to no longer be a recursive data structure [#63420](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/63420)
- There is ongoing work in both const prop and place refactorings.
- We've figured out a plan for "weird" place projections like dereferences (virtual locals).
