## Performance logs

> [triage logs 2021-12-14](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-12-14.md)

This week's report started with 6 regressions; after eliminating truly obvious noise, we are left with just 2 minor regressions. Of the cases that regressed, I think the only interesting one is keccak (regressed by 1.73% in PR #91549). But don't be too depressed: keccak was also improved up to 23% by PR [#85013](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85013) (!); thanks to @**simulacrum** for that PR.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [e2116acae59654bfab2a9729a024f3e2fd6d4b02..404c8471aba60c2d837fa728e7c729a0f52d5830](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=e2116acae59654bfab2a9729a024f3e2fd6d4b02&end=404c8471aba60c2d837fa728e7c729a0f52d5830&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

"Support AVR for inline asm!" [#91224](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91224)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c5c94945096265b6d675b2f55a247c4799de8d87&end=0b6f079e4987ded15c13a15b734e7cfb8176839f&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.8% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `externs`)
- This regression is solely isolated to variants of the `externs` benchmark.
- It seems like a near certainty that the regression reported here is noise exacerbated by this pathological benchmark.
- Marked as triaged.

"Eliminate ConstnessAnd again" [#91549](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91549)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=6bda5b331cfe7e04e1fe348c58a928fc2b650f4f&end=22f8bde876f2fa9c5c4e95be1bce29cc271f2b51&stat=instructions:u) (up to 3.1% on `full` builds of `inflate`)
- This PR went through many rounds of performance evaluation and tuning.
- The only "real" regressions are likely to be `inflate` and `keccak`, and I am suspicious of `inflate` based on its sensitivity in other PR's.
- I'm leaving this PR in this week's report largely just to draw attention to the problem we face in trying to evalute impact of cases like this.

#### Improvements

- "Avoid string validation in rustc_serialize, check a marker byte instead" [#91407](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91407)
- "Sync portable-simd to remove autosplats" [#91484](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91484)
- "replace vec::Drain drop loops with drop_in_place" [#85157](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85157)
- "replace dynamic library module with libloading" [#90716](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90716)
- "manually implement Hash for DefId" [#91660](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91660)

#### Mixed

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2af5c6562deed1878000e791f2cb21b981a53959&end=c67497a5da33eb3167a33e938920ce04d2b883a5&stat=instructions:u) (up to -23.6% on `full` builds of `keccak`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2af5c6562deed1878000e791f2cb21b981a53959&end=c67497a5da33eb3167a33e938920ce04d2b883a5&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)

"Rollup of 6 pull requests" [#91799](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91799)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b8dc6aa673317cf72a8abb9c421f573f2b34b47a&end=928783de663bd855a96f14b2d38c1061603587c6&stat=instructions:u) (up to -5.9% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `inflate`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b8dc6aa673317cf72a8abb9c421f573f2b34b47a&end=928783de663bd855a96f14b2d38c1061603587c6&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.8% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `issue-88862`)
- I don't yet now hat's up with the regression here to issue-88862.

"Deduplicate projection sub-obligations" [#90423](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90423)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a0a4c7d1e48c39a73119eb9107d402d60c83293b&end=4c9bdf4cbbf1deab0b5da398d4910558a66b332f&stat=instructions:u) (up to -6.2% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a0a4c7d1e48c39a73119eb9107d402d60c83293b&end=4c9bdf4cbbf1deab0b5da398d4910558a66b332f&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.5% on `full` builds of `regression-31157`)
- This is a targetted fix to address performance regressons that leaked into 1.57. It has been beta-nominated for backport.
