## Backport nominations

[T-compiler stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler) / [T-compiler beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)
- :beta: [1.73] "Add a way to decouple the implementation and the declaration of a TyCtxt method." [rust#116052](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116052)
  - patch authored by @***oli*
  - addresses #115819, which is meant to fix #83085
  - [Note](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116052#issuecomment-1734348940): either beta backport this or patch #115819 into beta branch (beta backport approved last week)
  - T-rustdoc is tagged but there seems to be little under `./src/librustdoc`. Under `./tools/miri` there's more: Should also some other team check this?

### P-critical

  - Agreed to leave it P-critical until today to measure impact after merging of #115215 (happened 2w ago). If no more people pile on this issue, evaluate a P-high downgrade

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2023-09-26](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2023-09-26.md)

A very quiet week with the only large change in performance being improvements brought on by @saethlin's work on cleaning up the `FileEncoder` used in various places like `rustc_metadata` and `rustc_serialize`.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

#### Mixed

Simplify/Optimize FileEncoder [#115542](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/115542) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ad36b5a622b0d6d6f0f3260049b2245ee1f27a07&end=3223b0b5e8dadda3f76c3fd1a8d6c5addc09599e&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 1.0%  | [0.7%, 1.3%]   | 2     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | -     | -              | 0     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -0.6% | [-1.2%, -0.2%] | 95    |
| Improvements (secondary) | -0.6% | [-1.2%, -0.3%] | 28    |
| All  (primary)           | -0.6% | [-1.2%, 1.3%]  | 97    |
- looks like a small regression snuck back in. The regressions seem real, but perhaps it's not worth it given the much larger amount of improvements.


Enable effects for libcore [#114776](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/114776) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=aace2dfa37f4589b0071530d2ed7b352f6196704&end=8759de0a4935e677fdce99a849addea2d5318da9&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.3%  | [0.3%, 0.4%]   | 4     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.6%  | [0.3%, 0.8%]   | 3     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -     | -              | 0     |

| All  (primary)           | 0.3%  | [0.3%, 0.4%]   | 4     |
- Per Oli: The perf run shows a few extra executions of queries and metadata encoding, which seems unavoidable to me. We may get the perf back when ripping out the const checker's logic that is only needed until we enable effects by default for doing const fn callability checks


Enable -Zdrop-tracking-mir by default [#107421](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107421) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=19c65022fc1ad9cc3d3dcf50a0bdf50e4ab572ab&end=13e6f24b9adda67852fb86538541adaa68aff6e8&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 0.4%  | [0.4%, 0.5%]   | 2     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 4.5%  | [0.3%, 6.5%]   | 9     |
| Improvements (primary)   | -0.4% | [-0.4%, -0.4%] | 1     |
| Improvements (secondary) | -2.5% | [-3.3%, -1.9%] | 5     |
| All  (primary)           | 0.2%  | [-0.4%, 0.5%]  | 3     |
- it seems the regressions to await-call-tree are real, but it's unclear what the underlying cause is.


Add the `cfg_match!` macro [#115416](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/115416) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=42ca6e4e5760a548a6fa858482de6d237f6fb3b8&end=8a6bae28247fbaa3257856e00d084ac8c90712f3&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
