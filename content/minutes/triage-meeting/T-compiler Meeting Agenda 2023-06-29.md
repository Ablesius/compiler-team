## Performance logs

Relatively quiet week outside of a large win on one incremental benchmark in a
regression test (i.e., not real world code). Bimodality in a number of
benchmarks continues to be an issue.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

The regression in diesel seems to have persisted in future commits, but PR
authors note that the code changed in this PR is not expected to affect
benchmarks, so it is likely to be optimizer noise of some kind.

Disable two mir opts that are known to be unsound [#112834](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112834) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=97bf23d26b1ffff46f071aa687945a6cf85a5914&end=38b44eb2335885844137f918c44c437f5a8da951&stat=instructions:u)

| All  (primary)           | 0.4%  | [0.3%, 0.9%]   | 48    |

Regression on multiple benchmarks, seems to be real, likely to be expected with
disabling of optimization passes.

Regressions are limited to subset of incremental benchmarks, multiple of which
are benchmarks prone to bimodality, with relatively low significance factors.
No further investigation warranted.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "'rustc' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: TryFromIntError(())" [rust#112934](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/112934)
  - Big source file size (~85K locs) breaks compilation with ICE
  - nominated by @**Ben Kimock (Saethlin)**
  - @**Esteban Küber** suggests maybe fixing the ICE and add a useful message ("split your project!") or add a compiler flag to enable a `u64` type index ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/112934#issuecomment-1603654299))
- "Linking error on Rust 1.70 aarch64-unknown-linux-musl toolchain" [rust#113104](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/113104)
  - @**Ben Kimock (Saethlin)** suggests could be related to #111888 (which was bisected to [#108017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/111888#issuecomment-1585690896))
  - nominated by @**apiraino**: are these class of breakages P-high's (seems to affect `musl` and `aarch64`, Tier 1 and 2) and if yes should these issues get some attention before next release?
  
[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- No I-compiler-nominated RFCs this time.
