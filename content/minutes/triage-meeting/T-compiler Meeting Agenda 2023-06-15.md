# T-compiler Meeting Agenda 2023-06-15

## Announcements

- Input from @**apiraino** (echoing [a comment](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202023-06-01/near/362796465) from @**Jack Huey**): rethinking WGs checkins in t-compiler meetings. Is the current rotation reflecting the reality? Suggests opening a topic under #**t-compiler** and discuss with the leads
- [Types team meeting](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=MTg3MDhpdTc3YXBqMGMzbnNxanUwdWZnazhfMjAyMzA2MTlUMTQwMDAwWiA2dTVycnRjZTZscnR2MDdwZmkzZGFtZ2p1c0Bn) at <time:2023-06-19T10:00:00-04:00>
- Reminder: if you see a PR/issue that seems like there might be legal implications due to copyright/IP/etc, please let the Core team know (or at least message @_**pnkfelix** or @_**Wesley Wiser** so we can pass it along).

### WG checkins

- @_*WG-self-profile* by @**mw** and @**Wesley Wiser** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/DzXUoPG6T-S5NfXcl8h1yg#WG-checkins)):
  > @**andjo403** modified the event file format to support ASCII newline characters in https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/pull/208. This resolved a panic that @**jyn** reported when profiling the compiler.

## Performance logs

Our build pipeline got sped up by PR #112012, which side-steps one of the rustc
rebuilds we were suffering with before. (There is further potential speed-up by
caching LLVM, as noted by on that PR.) Other than that, various small
regressions that are largely noise, as well as one unexpected increase in binary
sizes from PR #109005 that we should follow up on.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* only primary benchmark to regress was helloworld (3 incr check variants), and not by all that much (relatively speaking)
* secondary regressions were mainly to unify-linearly, await-call-tree, token-stream-stress.
* impact seems acceptable, marking as triaged.

* only primary benchmark to regress was helloworld (3 incr check variants), and not by all that much (relatively speaking)
* secondary regressions were solely to unify-linearly, await-call-tree, token-stream-stress.
* impact seems acceptable (one expects new lint to add some amount of extra work, and I wouldn't be surprised if this is actually noise,. given #112116 above).
* marking as triaged.

* primary regressions are to serde (check, debug, opt) and also cargo + webrender (both check)
* This PR added some extra work to the compiler to ensure some lazily-filled in tables are constructed correctly.
* Therefore, this seems like extra work that is largely unavoidable.
* marking as triaged.

* One of the rolled up PRs, PR #112528, is itself a partial revert of PR #110221, which yields the large compile-time losses noted here (solely for helloworld, it is worth noting).
* the point is, the gains were 1. accidental 2. isolated to a toy and 3. due to an unintended change (which was now reverted).
* marking as triaged.

* Interesting case where removing PGO data improved a class of benchmarks
* Specifically, nearly all the improvements were to debug builds
* this makes sense, because the PGO data we were gathering was during rustc bootstrap, which does not exercise the debug build paths.

* changes are all to secondary benchmarks
* only notable was coercions debug incr-full regressing by 5.7%, but that's acceptable given what we expect benefits to be here w.r.t. codegen.
* marking as triaged.

* effects are small enough that they would not block an LLVM upgrade
* marking as triaged.

* sole regression is to secondary coercions debug incr-full.
* not worth dissecting this rollup for that.
* marking as triaged.

* instruction counts regressed (expected) and binary sizes regressed (which may have been unexpected).
* specifically the binary sizes for libc and syn both regressed on the order of 3%.
* not marking as triaged until we get confirmation that it is expected for the metadata in question to leak into the binary sizes being measured.

* currently guessing that the regression here might be due to PR #109953.
* doing a specific rust-timer run now to check that, not marking as triaged for now.
