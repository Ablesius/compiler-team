# 2019-09-19

## Volunteers wanted

- "Better error message when attempting to instantiate tuple structs with private fields" [#58017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58017)
  - Volunteer wanted to bisect this issue.

## Backport nominations

- "fn ptr is structural match" [#64431](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64431)
  - Accepted for beta backport

- "fix nounwind attribute logic" [#63909](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/63909)
  - Declined for beta backport
  


## Working group sync

### [wg-self-profile](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/self-profile/)

Three main things being worked on:

1. Getting the "minimum viable product" done as planned [#58967](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58967)

2. Improving the ergonomics of self-profiling
  - we want to collect use cases on [irlo](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/compiler-profiling-survey/10969) and then try to come up with good, tooling assisted workflows for those use cases
  
3. Use self-profiling to implement a feature that allows to attribute compile time to specific parts of the source code
  - this feature is currently still in the brainstorming phase
  - comments welcome https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/issues/51

### [wg-rls-2.0](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rls-2.0/)

- Chalk has been integrated, a number of performance problems have been fixed, and now it works great!

- Macro by example and associated macro resolution work well enough to cover significant subset of the real world code

- We added a simple hack to show compiler errors by just running cargo check

- First win of librarification: rustc and rust-analyzer share the same lexer code!

- After slowing down during August, they are starting the next sprint. The goal is to library-ify type-relating things: so, chalk + unification + a definition of Ty
