### P-critical

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-compiler)
- "ld64.lld: error: too many personalities (4) for compact unwind to encode" [rust#102754](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/102754) 
  - LLD bug will be fixed by [llvm#D135728](https://reviews.llvm.org/D135728), (now merged)
  - A ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/102754#issuecomment-1285775499)) says that the LLD fix would not help, [suggests that an additional rustc fix is needed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/102754#issuecomment-1284345364)
  - note: I assume the above commenter is referring to "us" as in "Brave browser developers" (by looking at their github profile), so unrelated to the issue reporter (Firefox)
- "Rust update from 1.63 to 1.64 introduce lifetime problem on build" [rust#103141](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103141) 
  - fixed by #103205, it's open to track beta+stable backports
- "regression: associated consts cannot be referenced in patterns" [rust#103242](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103242) 
  - Will be fixed by [rust#103279](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103279) (beta accepted)
- "regression: trait bound not satisfied" [rust#103243](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103243) 
  - Will be fixed by [rust#103279](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103279) (beta accepted)
- "function lifetime elision changed in 1.64" [rust#103330](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103330)
  - @**simulacrum** [reports from T-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103330#issuecomment-1291136085) that this should be reverted but given that the 1.64 is almost out, the fix will probably slip to 1.65

[T-rustdoc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-rustdoc)

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2022-10-26](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/5841a42e4edc3b7bebd449c753c4e0d4df1f4c92/triage/2022-10-26.md)

An amazing week. We saw more wins than losses; I want to call out specifically
the wins from removing attributes from metadata (up to 8.2% faster builds for 18
benchmarks) and from enabling LTO for rustc_driver.so (up to 9.6% faster builds
for an epic 230 benchmarks, with *zero* regressions).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [e0f8e60d..629a414d](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=e0f8e60dddfecfc9093ee9d9f42557d8260c0355&end=629a414d7ba4caa3ca28b0a46c478e2ecb4c0059&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

* all of the primary regressions (which seem small) are all in incr-patched scenarios. Most are also check builds, though there is some debug and opt mixed in as well.
* hard to tell from the list of rolled up PR's which one(s) would be to blame here
* w.r.t. the secondary benchmarks, the main contributor (in terms of the max regression observed) is `deeply-nested-multi`, which regressed by 0.74--1.2% depending on the scenario.
  * (In this case, the 1.2% regression is to a full build, not an incremental one.)
* In any case, the sheer number of impacted benchmarks is large enough that this warrants further review. Not marking as triaged. I'll try to dig into it later.

#### Improvements

Use Set instead of Vec in transitive_relation [#103214](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103214) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d7dd01fe8b071602510eaac9f676acc0e3cf8e4a&end=4b8f4319954ff2642690b9e5cbe4af352d095bf6&stat=instructions:u)

| All  (primary)           | -0.6% | [-0.7%, -0.6%] | 2     |

* as noted in PR description: "doesn't fix the underlying quadraticness but it makes it a lot faster to an extent where even doubling the amount of nested references still takes less than two seconds (50s on nightly)."

Remove more attributes from metadata [#98450](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98450) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=657f246812ab2684e3c3954b1c77f98fd59e0b21&end=ba9d01be67a97dd6762935762172e37ee22083ae&stat=instructions:u)

* anyway, great work from @lqd and @GuillaumeGomez

stop using `ty::UnevaluatedConst` directly [#103227](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103227) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3022afe3d144ca6acd34da9846ab74fa51328fda&end=26c96e341639102afacbbcad0dc18ad0ac71ab18&stat=instructions:u)

* Holy cow: 9.6% faster compiling diesel, 7% faster compiling serde, 1.3% faster bootstrap. Epic wins there.
* there is perhaps concern that it caused [#103538](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103538): "rustc-dev component recently became a lot bigger"

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)
- "libcompiler-builtins contains DWARF5 debuginfo in 1.62.0" [rust#98746](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98746)
  - Nominated by Felix, this slipped prioritization and went unnoticed (I assume because not labelled as a regression)
- "Remove save-analysis." [rust#101841](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101841)
  - Nominated by Wesley to decide when landing this ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101841#issuecomment-1290609092)) and allow other tooling to migrate to `rust-analyzer` [Zulip discussion](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/Future.20of.20save-analysis/near/304896312)
  - and also how to give proper notice (@**nnethercote** [comment](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/Future.20of.20save-analysis/near/305921181))
 
[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)
- No nominated RFCs for `T-compiler` this time.

## Next week's WG checkins
