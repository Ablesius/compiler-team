### WG checkins

- @_*WG-polymorphization* by @**davidtwco** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/Fv3TSalbT_CYVUEonihWzg#WG-checkins)):
  > There's no update from wg-polymorphization again this cycle, we think it'll benefit from the trait system refactor work being spearheaded by lcnr.


- @_*WG-rls2.0* by @**Lukas Wirth** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/tMRw5amiR7GFBATOFLfEkA#WG-checkins)):
    > GAT support in r-a landed just a few days before stabilization of the feature. Some improvements were done for making the linkedProjects config of r-a work better for the rust-lang/rust repo. An [RFC#3344](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3344) has been written that would allow us to get rid of the `RUSTC_WRAPPER` hack in rust-analyzer. Finally we looked a bit more into whether turning `library` into a separate workspace would be feasible such that r-a can resolve third party crates used by std as that is still blocking a type inference PR from landing in r-a, unfortunately that seems to introduce too much churn [zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/rust-lang.2Frust.2Flibrary.20workspace).

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2022-11-14](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-11-14.md)

A light week for triage. The biggest of the three regressions has a (hopeful)
fix up already. The second biggest is a regression we are accepting for sake
of correctness of incremental-compilation. The third regression is small and may
well be removed as the type system internals are improved. max-rss seems stable.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [57d3c58e..96ddd32c](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=57d3c58ed6e0faf89a62411f96c000ffc9fd3937&end=96ddd32c4bfb1d78f0cd03eb068b1710a8cebeef&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

* Already triaged (by two different people).
* Also, according to comment thread, this change is slated to be removed once
  binders support implied bounds, so even if there is a minor regression
  attached to this PR, the PR should nonetheless go away eventually.

- "Panic on invalid usages of `MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()`" [rust#100423](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100423)
  - @**RalfJ** provides great summary [in this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100423#issuecomment-1304781140)
- "const eval interpreter step limit being hit on nightly for long-running while loop" [rust#103814](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103814)
  - `#[const_eval_limit]` is now on nightly, people are tripping over it (comments in #93481)
  - @**pnkfelix** says: the lang team *did* discuss #103877 yesterday, and I think we managed to convince niko that shifting from a hard error to a lint is reasonable
  - Felix mentions for context also #67217
