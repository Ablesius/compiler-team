### [wg-polymorphization]

> Since this is the first update to the compiler team meeting, this working group is my work for my master's thesis - it aims to implement an analysis to detect when functions could remain polymorphic during code generation. Hopefully this will reduce the amount of LLVM IR generated and improve compilation times.

> So far, I've got a basic analysis working and I've got it integrated into the compiler such that a codegen-unit test that I've written pass with the analysis turned on and working. For the last couple months, I've been working on getting the compiler to bootstrap with the analysis turned on, and fighting ICEs to do so.

### [wg-traits]

- Planning is beginning to do a new set of "sprints".

- The current goal is to implement some of the ideas learned from Chalk into rustc and make it able to support GATs etc while still working on Chalk with the goal of eventual rustc integration.
  - We want to start getting value out of the Chalk ideas now rather than waiting until it can be fully integrated with rustc.
