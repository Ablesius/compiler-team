## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2023-06-20](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/d9c55fb1800a1a32a73b8f1ff7e97b38047a7fc7/triage/2023-06-20.md)

Fairly positive week with very few regressions and some decent (albeit incremental) improvements. The most widespread gains came from some standard library improvements which are not a particularly common cause of large improvements in compiler performance. Overall a large chunk of the perf test suite showed an average of 0.6% improvement.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
