### WG checkins

- Generic Associated Types initiative by @**Jack Huey** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/P5_PrNfwR6Sp89yQ_S3-jg#WG-checkins)):
  > No big changes. A couple small diagnostic additions:
  > - Implied static bug note readded: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101924
  > - Better error when using GATs in generator interiors: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103171
  >
  > Aside: I've seen several crates being published (from Reddit) mentioning GATs usage, so stabilization seems to be helpful and relatively smooth.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2022-11-29](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/472dbb513c9db62cdf74d5e9376f7b462216e3ff/triage/2022-11-29.md)

A relatively quiet week for performance, with the notable exception of "Avoid
`GenFuture` shim when compiling async constructs [#104321](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104321)"
 which brought sizeable wins on a number of stress test benchmarks. It probably
won't be of huge benefit to most codebases, but should provide smaller wins to
folks with large amounts of async-generated futures.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [a78c9bee4d9d51a3891bd8ecae1f28a93b83653b..8a09420ac48658cad726e0a6997687ceac4151e3](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=a78c9bee4d9d51a3891bd8ecae1f28a93b83653b&end=8a09420ac48658cad726e0a6997687ceac4151e3&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

This PR was a perf regression (see the report here
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104758#issuecomment-1325100344). It's
relatively small and mostly limited to secondary workloads so I'm marking as
triaged.

Branch Clause from Predicate [#104846](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104846) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e704e95250ff4e949214f390a88f21d08052bea1&end=051cab2b842113b18da28259f4b85d0a7556f7f1&stat=instructions:u)

Unexpected regression, PR reviewer and author are going to look into it.

| All  (primary)           | 0.3%  | [0.2%, 0.5%]   | 6     |

Previous perf runs showed slight improvements, but the post-merge one shows regressions. They are mostly among secondary benchmarks.

Some followup discussion on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/104807 but
overall a roughly neutral change.

Relatively few relatively small changes, no further investigation needed.

keccak improvements may be spurious but overall neutral so no further investigation warranted.
