## Performance logs

> [2022-06-21 Triage Log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-06-21.md)

A pretty busy week for performance, with quite a few PRs landing with
significant improvements to specific benchmarks. Overall the week was positive,
with many benchmarks improving at least a little. No significant changes in
memory usage this week.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

This regression is largely fixed by [#98178](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98178).

Slight regressions to small number of doc benchmarks, likely due to slightly
more work during generation (std's docs changed).

Fix `SourceScope` for `if let` bindings. [#97931](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97931)
[(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=17c6bde14eabdd61c35505ed6834ee9196c2fdc9&end=9a0b7749665d925d8f533756149deba74f2db88b&stat=instructions:u)

| Regressions  (secondary)  | 0.3% | 0.3% | 1     |
| Improvements  (primary)   | N/A  | N/A  | 0     |
| Improvements  (secondary) | N/A  | N/A  | 0     |
| All  (primary)            | 0.4% | 0.5% | 4     |

Regression is pretty small and only one primary benchmark is affected (regex),
and only incremental scenarios there. Likely not enough to worry about.

Obligation forest tweaks [#97674](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97674)
[(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=4104596251818f4f588051c7a8172ca9f5a195bf&end=1d6010816c37186e2bee316709f0c0197c427513&stat=instructions:u)

|                           | mean  | max   | count |
|:-------------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Regressions  (primary)    | 0.8%  | 0.9%  | 2     |
| Regressions  (secondary)  | 1.8%  | 2.4%  | 7     |
| Improvements  (primary)   | N/A   | N/A   | 0     |

| All  (primary)            | 0.8%  | 0.9%  | 2     |

keccak is the primary affected benchmark, and is known to be very sensitive to
changes to the obligation forest code. See some analysis in this
[comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97674#issuecomment-1160914976)
following up on the results from the merge perf run.

|                           | mean  | max   | count |
|:-------------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Regressions  (primary)    | 0.3%  | 0.3%  | 2     |

| All  (primary)            | 0.3%  | 0.3%  | 2     |

Cause of regressions is unclear, but they're minor enough that it's not worth
the hassle of investigating a rollup.

A solid improvement, though just to the one benchmark; coercions change in the
regressions section is likely just noise, not an actual meaningful delta.

Large change (over 2000 lines changed) that is a first step for further work on
constant evaluation in the compiler. Overall this is still an improvement, and
regressions are primarily on stress tests. See [this
comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96591#issuecomment-1156381494)
for some further context.
