- "Tracking Issue for `debugger_visualizer`" [rust#95939](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95939)
  - nominated by @**lcnr** after comment from @**ehuss** ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95939#issuecomment-1537190916)), concern about stabilization as it is today
  - either fix or revert - suggests @**Michael Goulet (compiler-errors)**

  - PR work in progress, current design seems to be in need of some work. PR author @**Vincenzo Palazzo** asks for mentoring / design suggestions
  - PR received comments, was also discussed on Zulip [here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/macro.20grow.20limit.20expansion.20discussion) and [here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/rustc_expand.20keep.20into.20count.20expansion.20limit.20also.20the))
  - [comments from vincenzopalazzo]: a good summary of what it is going one this [this one](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/rustc_expand.20keep.20into.20count.20expansion.20limit.20also.20the/near/292808431)
  - Some open questions are:
    - This may result in a breaking change if we patch this case for all kind of macros (quote may impacted and this implies a very big numbers of macros)
    - An idea is to patch only the buggy macros with the bang operator (mentioned in the PR), and then in a new edition put this for all the other macros?

[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- No I-compiler-nominated RFCs this time.
