### [wg-learning]

Accomplished:

- We have a [chapter about Salsa][salsa_chapter], it was summarized from [this lecture][lecture_1].

- We have a [PR for the ty chapter][ty_chapter], it summarizes [this lecture][lecture_2].

-  We had a [planning meeting][meeting], where we come up with a [document with ideas and next steps][doc] for the rustc-guide. We've basically defined kind of a roadmap and a way to work towards those goals.

Next-steps:

- Start writing an Overview chapter

- Organize a lecture about codegen mir -> llvm IR ([@nagisa], maybe?)

- Organize a lecture about LLVM ([@alexcrichton], maybe?)

- Organize a lecture about monomorphization/type memory layout ([@oli-obk], maybe?)
