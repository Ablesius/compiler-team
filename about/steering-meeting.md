The compiler **steering meeting** is the place for high-level
discussion and planning. The meeting takes place every three weeks --
so twice per release. There is a [thread on internals][internals]
where we discuss what we will be talking about and also scheduling
decisions; there is also a calendar invite, you can ping
`@nikomatsakis` to be added.

[internals]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/compiler-steering-meeting/8588

The steering meeting takes place on [Zulip](chat-platform.md).  Look
for a topic like "steering meeting YYYY-MM-DD" (with today's date, of
course).
