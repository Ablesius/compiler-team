The compiler **triage meeting** is the place for tracking regressions
and progress on urgent bugs. The meeting takes place every week.  It
is currently scheduled for Fridays at 10am Boston time (note that we
track the US when it comes to Daylight Savings Time). There is also a
calendar invite, you can ping `@nikomatsakis` to be added.

The triage meeting takes place on [Zulip](chat-platform.md).  Look for
a topic like "#54818 weekly meeting YYYY-MM-DD" or "weekly meeting
YYYY-MM-DD" (with the proper date, of course).
