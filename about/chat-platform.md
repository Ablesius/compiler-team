The compiler team hangs out primarily in [the rust-lang Zulip][z]
these days, specifically in the `#t-compiler` stream. 

You can also find us on [the rust-lang Discord][d], in the `#compiler`
channel.

The `#rustc` IRC channel on `irc.mozilla.org` is in a
"quasi-deprecated" status and is not recommended.
